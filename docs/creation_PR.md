## How to create Pull Request

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Create a new branch, make your changes, and push the branch to GitHub.
3. Create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your branch into the `master` branch.
4. After the merge, all changes are automatically deployed to the Cloud.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- The PR name should contain the JIRA number and a short overview of the changes.
- The commit message should include brief information about the changes.
